# Domain Adaptation for Remote Sensing in Scene Classification: An Investigation into Adaptive Dropout and Adaptive Batch Normalization Techniques

This repository contains code for domain adaptation experiments with the focus on adapting between AID (Aerial Image Dataset) and UCM (UC Merced Land Use Dataset).

## üìÑ Documentation

The project's full report, containing the research methods, datasets used, and results can be found in [`AdaptiveDA_report.pdf`](AdaptiveDA_report.pdf).

## üìÇ Directory Structure

- `src/dann.py`: Domain-Adversarial Neural Network implementation
- `src/dataset_creation.py`: Script for dataset pre-processing and data loaders
- `src/deepcoral.py`: Implementation of Deep CORAL (CORrelation ALignment)
- `src/lower_bound.py`: Lower bound
- `src/upper_bound.py`: Upper bound
- `src/utils.py`: Utility functions including model architectures and helper functions

## üì¶ Requirements

You can install the required packages using the following command:

\`\`\`
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

## üéØ Datasets

- [AID: Aerial Image Dataset](https://captain-whu.github.io/AID/)
- [UCM: UC Merced Land Use Dataset](http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html)

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. Clone the repository:

\`\`\`
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YourRepositoryName.git
\`\`\`

2. Install the requirements:

\`\`\`
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

3. Create a folder named 'data' and install the required datasets there.

\`\`\`
mkdir data
\`\`\`

3. Run the script for the adaptation method you're interested in. For example, to run DANN:

\`\`\`
cd src
python dann.py
\`\`\`

4. The output results will be displayed on the console and can be further analyzed as per your requirements.
